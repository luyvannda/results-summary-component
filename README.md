## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I have learned to used CSS relative units and css functions like min, max and clamp to build a responsive website and Sass mixin for media queries. 

### Continued development

In future projects, I hope to improve my skills in Sass mixin, and hopefully get to build new projects with React.
